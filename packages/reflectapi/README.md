# @velocejs/reflectapi

This is for capture a class method structure for creating the `Validator` decorator.
We make this standalone because it has many different usage.

Currently it's using [ts-morph]() to capture the Typescript AST.

It's an internal method there is no need to install, its part of a larger package [@velocejs/fastapi]()
