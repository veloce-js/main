// dumb way to make send of the method that the decorator apply
// The problem is when you apply the decorator, it's at design time (TS)
// but it actually run on the run time (JS) so you don't really got any type info
// try the ts-morph facing the same situation. So we need to find away to
// parse the file at TS stage to extract the Type info for Validation

export function extractArgs(fnStr: string) {
  console.log(fnStr)
