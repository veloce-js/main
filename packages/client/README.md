# @velocejs/client

This is the client module for use in node / browser environment.

The main use is automatically fetch the contract from a Velocejs server, then general
client side code to call the API defined on the server side - with validation as well
as all the other repetitive task you normally need to do with developing a server / client application.

It's all about DRY!

The idea is based on our other framework [jsonql](https://jsonql.js.org) which actually use many of the
parts from it.

** Coming soon **
