# @veloce/setup

This is a command line app that will setup your Velocejs appliation (Vue 3 + Vite + uWebSocket.js)

## Installation

```sh
$ npx @velocejs/setup@latest
```
Then follow the instruction.

**It's important to add the `@latest` due to npx use cache (meaning if you use it once, it won't update and keep
use the old version, which is super bad)**

You can also install this globally

```sh
$ npm install --global @velocejs/setup
```

Then you can run the command `veloce`

```sh
$ veloce
```
